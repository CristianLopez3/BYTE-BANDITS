# INTEGRAL DEVELOPMENT SENASOFT PEREIRA 2023

This project is part of the SENASOFT competition and is focused on fostering comprehensive skills development in the field of programming and building REST APIs with Spring Boot.

## Project Description

The primary objective of this project is to showcase the skills acquired during the SENASOFT competition, with a specific emphasis on developing applications based on REST APIs. Here, you'll find a sample application built using Spring Boot that demonstrates best practices and end-to-end development techniques.

## Features

- Developed in Java with Spring Boot.
- RESTful API for performing CRUD operations.
- Exemplifies best practices in end-to-end development.
- Provides API documentation for ease of use.

## Development Requirements

To work on this project, you'll need the following tools and technologies:

- Java Development Kit (JDK-17)
- Spring Boot (3.1.4)
- Additional dependencies as needed
- Configure your preferred IDE integration

## Technologies

- Java 17
- Trello
- Spring Boot
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- MySQL

## Methodologies

To develop our product for the SENASOFT competition, we've embraced current best practices in software development. We use Scrum to effectively manage the project, focus on delivering value, and adapt agilely to any changes that may arise during the development process.

## Design Patterns

- REST
- MVC
- DTO
- DAO
- Client-Server
- Separation of Concerns

## Usage Instructions

1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up your development environment with the required dependencies.
3. Run the Spring Boot application.
4. Access the API documentation to learn more about the available endpoints and how to use them.


## CORS Handling and API Consumption

This project includes CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration to ensure secure interactions between different origins. CORS is controlled in the project's configurations to specify which domains are allowed to make requests to the API.

While CORS is managed within the project, we highly recommend consuming the API from client-side applications using JavaScript libraries like Axios. This approach not only simplifies cross-origin requests but also provides more control and flexibility when interacting with the API.

By utilizing Axios or similar JavaScript libraries, you can seamlessly integrate the API into your web applications while maintaining a high level of security and control over your API interactions.
